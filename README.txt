Windows Install Directions--------------------------Before running planets, you need to make sure that you have Tcl/Tk 8.3installed.  You can get it here:http://downloads.activestate.com/ActiveTcl/Windows/8.3.4/ActiveTcl8.3.4.1-9.win32-ix86.exeOnce it's installed, you may need to reboot, to ensure that the path to theTcl libraries (typically C:\Tcl) is in your path.  You can add it manually ifyou like.Note that you also need the cygwin dll, which is included in the zip file.If you already have cygwin installed, then you can run planets from thecygwin command line without this dll.Take a look at getting_started.html to get a sense of how to use theprogram, and look at KEYBINDINGS.txt to see the full set of keybindings.
